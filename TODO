Todo items:

*) Add docstrings to all functions/scripts

*) Compile the ReadMe that encompasses all scripts (README.md found in src)
    # The point of this is to have a list of each script in src, which in turn contain lists of the docstrings of each function in those scripts. 

*) Fix how long nPSF takes to perform the latlon transformations - Ben says he'll do this

*) Empirical PSFs (npsf_empirical.py, analysis_emp.py)
    # These scripts bypass the normal npsf_run.py and analysis.py because it allows the user to enter their own "empirical" psf rather than having Tinytim generate it for them. 
    # This script worked for the empirical psfs generated by a fellow coworker (Seneca Heilesen), but it has not been tested to see if it works for any additional empirical psf situations. 

*) Compare plots (3plot_compare.py)
    # Prints a plot of the residuals in a 3 psf run as individual residual plots side by side.
    # This code was never fixed so as to accomplish the correct residual application as desired by Dr. Ragozzine. It was also never incorporated into analysis.py as a normal plot to be included in the results file. 

*) 2d Gaussian Mixture Model (Ask Dr. Ragozzine)

*) optimizer code (npsf_run.py, optimize.py)
    # Optimizer code is not what was expected, needs to be fixed. Perhaps a different method than scipy.optimize.minimize is required. Dependency on steps and burnin provided in the runprops needs to be removed so that the optimization runs to its full extent.
