nPSF is designed to be a code that returns a likelihood map for the 
relative positions of multiple (n) PSFs in an image. It's goal is to 
provide likelihood information for relative astrometry, e.g., KBO moons.

nPSF relies on installation of TinyTim to model HST PSFs. To install enter the tinytim-7.5 
directory. Then use the following command (if on linux):

make linux

Then in your .bashrc, paste the following commands:

TINYTIM=/usr/local/tinytim
export TINYTIM
alias tiny1=’$TINYTIM/tiny1’
alias tiny2=’$TINYTIM/tiny2’
alias tiny3=’$TINYTIM/tiny3’

Lastly, in src/tinytim_psfs/make_psf.py, change the entry on line 44 to match the location
of your TinyTim install. Once all this has been changed, nPSF should work fully. 


nPSF is partialy funded by HST-14560.002 on finding the orbit of the moon of 2013 FY27.
