One thing that I noticed was that in the npsf_run.py files, it runs based on likelihood and different parameters. It also mentions an unwritten dictionary, which I am assuming provides additional parameters and conditions. I would like to do what I can to learn about what types of parameters would be in that dictionary and hopefully contribute to putting it together. I mostly want to do that because I am hoping it will help me gain a better understanding of the statistical analysis we've been learning about.
