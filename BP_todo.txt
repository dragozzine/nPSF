Ben Proudfoot's to do list for nPSF to get it running:

Streamline input of parameters to be similar to multimoon

Begin integration with TinyTim using https://bitbucket.org/brgillis/tinytim_psfs/src/master/

Think about how we will account for telescope breathing
	-I think the best way to do this is to run nPSF several times with the different focus values for TT psfs and see which one is best....
	-To account for focus changes, nPSF can be run with the focus as an input parameter
	 at the start of the run, create tiny tim psfs for a range of focus values and then 
	 have the focus as a floating coninuous parameter which is then rounded. This will 
	 allow nPSF to, in a bayesian manner, select the correct focus value. The resulting
	 posterior will be ugly, but it should be perfectly valid (as confirmed by DFM and Hogg).
	 The only decision which will need to be made is how we want to store the PSFs throughout
	 the nPSF run. They could all be held in memory, but that could be memory-intensive.
	 There don't need to be too many focus values available, maybe only 5-10??

Parallelization. This is gonna be important, especially when we are running all images through with different focus values.

Optimization and automation... It's gonna be difficult if I have to manually run nPSF on all HST images. 
	-autorun will be a big deal...
	-additionally, have an auto burnin

Begin testing recoverability of satellites/binaries for HFM observations
